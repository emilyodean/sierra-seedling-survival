####Problem Statement

Due largely to a strong science-based management approach, salmon in Alaska persist. However, it is difficult for many stakeholders of Alaska’s salmon system to readily access up-to-date, accurate or integrated information. Existing information is often fragmented and/or ignores a significant body of indigenous knowledge. In addition, due to insufficient interdisciplinary methods to process available data, there are still salmon science and management/policy questions that have not been addressed.

Consequently, these knowledge gaps leave many stakeholders inadequately informed about the status of salmon.  This undermines their ability to equitably and knowledgeably participate in management decisions such as resource allocation, policy creation, and governance. Through a knowledge synthesis, SASAP seeks to provide an up-to-date interdisciplinary perspective on Alaska’s salmon systems and the people who rely on them to inform systematic salmon reporting programs at the state and national levels.

####Goals
The SASAP project specifically seeks to:

Connect knowledge across disciplines and agencies, between cultures and users, and across regions. This synthesis will help gain a broad view of this complex and dynamic system in order to set shared research priorities, develop and monitor indicators of Alaska’s salmon system health and drive sustainable management of the system

Create new institutional capacity to generate interdisciplinary salmon knowledge and establish a foundation for integrated knowledge that can be built on over time

####Our Science
This map shows the difference in size for pre-1990 fish and post-2000 fish. Differences were calculated only for those watersheds that had 4 or more valid years worth of data in each (pre 1990 and post 2000) time period. Years were considered valid if they had more than 100 ASL data points (i.e., 100 or more fish were measured). Note that the color scales are different for each plot due to different ranges of change for each species. You can see the yearly means that contributed to each calculation by holding the cursor over each watershed.
